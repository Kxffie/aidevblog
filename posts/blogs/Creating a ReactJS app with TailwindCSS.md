## What is TailwindCSS?

TailwindCSS is a CSS framework designed to make it easier for developers to create custom, responsive designs. It provides a set of utility classes that allow developers to quickly create custom designs without having to write or modify any CSS code. TailwindCSS also provides a set of components that can be used to quickly create common UI elements.

## What is ReactJS?

ReactJS is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides a powerful means of creating dynamic, interactive web applications. ReactJS is based on a component-based architecture, which allows developers to create reusable components that can be used in multiple applications.

For a more in-depth look at ReactJS, check out our [ReactJS tutorial](/Creating%20a%20ReactJS%20app).

## How to Make a TailwindCSS with ReactJS App

1. Install the TailwindCSS and ReactJS packages using npm or yarn. 
2. Create a ReactJS application using the create-react-app command. 
3. Install the TailwindCSS plugin for React. 
4. Import TailwindCSS into your ReactJS application. 
5. Create React components and utilize TailwindCSS classes to style them. 
6. Utilize React state and props to add dynamic user interaction. 
7. Test your application in the browser.

## Example TailwindCSS with ReactJS App

Let's take a look at an example of a TailwindCSS with ReactJS application. We will create a simple page that displays a list of items. We will use components to create the page structure and TailwindCSS classes to style the page. 

First, we will create a React component that renders the page's basic structure.

```js
import React from 'react';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div className="container mx-auto">
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold mb-4">My List</h1>
      <ul className="list-disc">
        <li>Item 1</li>
        <li>Item 2</li>
        <li>Item 3</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Next, we will use TailwindCSS classes to style the page.

```css
.container {
  @apply mx-auto;
}

h1 {
  @apply text-4xl font-bold mb-4;
}

ul {
  @apply list-disc;
}
```

## Conclusion

TailwindCSS with ReactJS is a powerful combination of two technologies that can be used to create modern, dynamic web applications. TailwindCSS provides a highly customizable CSS framework that makes it easy to create custom designs and ReactJS provides the underlying architecture for building dynamic, user-interactive applications. By using TailwindCSS with ReactJS, developers can quickly create beautiful, responsive web applications.
